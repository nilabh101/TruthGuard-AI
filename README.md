# TruthGuard-AI
AI-Powered Misinformation, Image & Deepfake Detection Platform

TruthGuard AI is a full-stack, multi-modal verification system designed to detect misinformation, AI-generated images, and manipulated or deepfake videos. Built with a modern frontend and a robust AI backend, the platform provides transparent, explainable, and confidence-based analysis rather than black-box judgments.

This project was developed as a hackathon-grade prototype focused on accuracy, reliability, and real-world applicability.
